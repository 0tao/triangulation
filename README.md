image triangulation experiment
===

this is an experiment for the web browser. it uses the [delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) algorithm to alter an image.

this experiment is very much based on @akm2's [triangulation image generator](http://jsdo.it/akm2/xoYx) script. It includes several speed enhancements (my aim is to make it fast enough for use with real time streaming input, e.g. from a web cam )
